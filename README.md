Air Force Field Training Scheduling System (FTSS)
====

[Production Site](http://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ftss)

FTSS provides a cradle-to-grave training requirements and scheduling workflow for US Air Force field training.  This is a production system running on the Air Force's Enterprise SharePoint platform and leverages [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) to interact with SP 2010's oData REST API.

FTSS is written in JavaScript, [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org) with [Brunch](http://brunch.io) for the application builds.  Though this application is restricted to US Air Force members, this code is released under the MIT License by [Jeff McCoy](http://jeffm.us).
