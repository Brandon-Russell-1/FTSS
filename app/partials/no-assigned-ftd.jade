    p.
        Sorry for the trouble, but it looks like you have the FTD Scheduler role without an assigned FTD.
        FTSS now requires every user with the FTD scheduler role to be assigned to their FTD.  If someone else in
        your FTD has proper access, they can assign you simply by adding you as an instructor and entering
        your AFNET email address:

    h4 {{myEmail}}

    br

    p.lead You may be able to fix this yourself using the link below:

    .row.text-center
        a.lead(href='https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ftss#reset') https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ftss#reset

    br

    p.italics.
        The FTSS team has been notified about your problem and should be getting in touch with you soon to
        resolve the issue.  Thank you for your patience!
