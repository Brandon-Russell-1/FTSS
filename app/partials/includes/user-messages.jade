    // These are the top navigation area buttons & search boxes listed from left to right ==============================

    #record-count.
        Displays the record  count for your search.  If the background is <span style="color:#d58512;font-weight:800">orange</span>,
        there were too many records found so you'll want to refine your search a little by adding more search tags.

    #tagBox.
        [icon=info-circle] To get started, create a search by combining tags using this search box.  Once you are done, press
        ENTER or click outside this box to start your search.

    #searchBox.
        [icon=info-circle] This search box lets you do full-text instant searches.  The more words you add, the more specific
        your search will be.  I.e., "robins engines" would find any data that included <i>both</i> "robins" and "engines".

        view a course, select the FTD you will request from (the closest available will be selected by default), and
        select the students who will take the course that month. As you select the students, a summary list on the
        right will display your draft 898. Once your list is complete, click each FTD base header on the right side
        to confirm and submit each base 898 request for MTF CC/Chief approval.
