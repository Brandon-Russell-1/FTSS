    #record-count.
        Displays the record  count for your search.  If the background is <span style="color:#d58512;font-weight:800">orange</span>,
        there were too many records found so you'll want to refine your search a little by adding more search tags.

    #tagBox.
        [icon=info] To get started, create a search by combining tags using this search box.  Once you are done, press
        ENTER or click outside this box to start your search.

    #searchBox.
        [icon=info] This search box lets you do full-text instant searches.  The more words you add, the more specific
        your search will be.  I.e., "robins engines" would find any data that included <i>both</i> "robins" and "engines".

    // Manage Students Page ============================================================================================

    #students.
        After your unit is added under the Host Units tab, add all Airmen requiring FTD training here. Backlog
        tracking required by AFI will be automated from this data.

        After establishing training requirements here, you can generate 898 requirements from your backlog by using
        the Generate 898 tab.  If you use IMDS to track FTD training, the course codes are already loaded into FTSS
        so you can just drag and drop a student's 593 to load their training requirements.

    #modal-students.
        Add each student in your unit that will require FTD courses. You can look up their name in the GAL using the
        name search option, and you can drag and drop their IMDS 593, which will automatically decipher the courses
        the student requires according to the IMDS 593.

    #students-name Enter student name

    #students-unit Unit this student is assigned to.

    #students-email This email address may be used to send FTSS notifications about the student's FTD class

    #students-date (optional) This is the in-processing date for the student,<br>it is used to sort students by
    longest wait-time and is designed to help you decide who may need the class more than the rest to reduce overdues.

    #students-category Choose the student type; this is used in conjunction with TDY status to determine the seat request type.

    #students-training
        p.
            This is a list of all the training requirements for this student.
            When a student is scheduled for a given course, it is automatically removed from this list.<br>
        This data can also be imported from an IMDS 593 using one of three ways:<br>
        ol
            li Copy & paste the text anywhere on this screen.
            li Drag & drop the text file onto this window.
            li Click the import button below & load the text file.




    // Generate 898 Page ===============================================================================================

    #generate-898.
        This page shows the current backlog for a unit and enables you to generate an electronic 898. To get started,
        view a course, select the FTD you will request from (the closest available will be selected by default), and
        select the students who will take the course that month. As you select the students, a summary list on the
        right will display your draft 898. Once your list is complete, click each FTD base header on the right side
        to confirm and submit each base 898 request for MTF CC/Chief approval.

    #modal-aaa-eval.
        The text below was pulled from this AAA report to create the backlog.  You can use this to validate the parsed

         group level unless you are a detachment (eg 826 AMXS at Nellis AFB is detached from their group at Moody AFB).

    #hosts-name Ex: 461 MXG

    #hosts-ftd.
