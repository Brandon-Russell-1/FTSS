        at a particular unit to FTSS as well as annotate the contact email.

    #students.
        In FTSS, you should add all Airmen requiring FTD training upfront.
        By doing so, we can automate the backlog tracking required by AFI.
        After establishing your training requirements here, you can generate 898
        requirements from your backlog.  If you use IMDS to track FTD training,
        the course codes are already loaded into FTSS so you can just drag and drop
        a student's 593 to load their training requirements.
