    #record-count.
        Displays the record  count for your search.  If the background is <span style="color:#d58512;font-weight:800">orange</span>,
        there were too many records found so you'll want to refine your search a little by adding more search tags.

    #tagBox.
        [icon=info] Use this search box to create custom queries that you can <i>bookmark or share</i>.
        Combine as many as you like, the first row of tags in <i><b>bold-italics</b></i> are custom searches for this page.

    #searchBox.
        [icon=info] This search box lets you do full-text instant searches.  The more words you add,
        the more specific your search will be.  I.e., "robins engines" would find any data that included <i>both</i> robins and engines.

    #button-clear Clear this search

    #button-grouping Change how data is grouped

    #button-sorting Change the sorting order

    #button-collapse Toggle expanded or collapsed rows

    #button-archive Toggle visibility of archived data




    // Manage Students Page ============================================================================================

    #students.
          In FTSS, you should add all Airmen requiring FTD training upfront.
          By doing so, we can automate the backlog tracking required by AFI.
          After establishing your training requirements here, you can generate 898
          requirements from your backlog.  If you use IMDS to track FTD training,
          the course codes are already loaded into FTSS so you can just drag and drop
          a student's 593 to load their training requirements.

    #modal-students.
        @TODO, Need to add some instructions here....

    #students-name @TODO, this is this name field when editing an existing student

    #students-unit @TODO The unit this student is assigned to.

            This is a list of all the training requirements for this student.
            When a student is scheduled for a given course, it is automatically removed from this list.<br>
        example This data can also be imported from an IMDS 593 using one of three ways:<br>

    // Generate 898 Page ===============================================================================================

    #generate-898.
        This page shows the current backlog for a unit and enables you to generate an electronic 898.  To get started,
        you should build a list of requests by choosing an FTD (the closest available will be selected by default) and list
        of students for each course needed.  As you choose students, a summary list on the right will display your requirements.  Once
        your list is completed, click the FTD base on the right side to confirm and submit each requirement (there will be
        one 898 generated per FTD).

    #backlog-graph-view Click to toggle the backlog graphs & statistics for this unit.

    #modal-backlog.
        Verify the students month for this request (top-right), courses and student names.  When you are done,
        press the verify button to confirm your requestion and then submit.

    // Host Units Page =================================================================================================

    #hosts.
          Before a student can be added to FTSS (required for 898s), the host unit must be added.
          Use this page to add or edit hosts units.  If the unit has a local FTD, be sure to add
          that to the unit as this is used in determining if this is a local or TDY request.

    #modal-hosts.
         The Host Unit must first be added before students can be loaded into FTSS.
         Ideally, you should keep host units no lower than a group level but any level is permitted.
         Be sure to choose a local FTD only if this unit is co-located with a FTD.
